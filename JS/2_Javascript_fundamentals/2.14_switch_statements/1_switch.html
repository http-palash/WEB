    <h1>The "switch" statement</h1>

    <p>
        A switch statement can replace multiple if checks.

        It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.
    </p>

    <p>
        switch(x) {
        case 'value1': // if (x === 'value1')
        ...
        [break]

        case 'value2': // if (x === 'value2')
        ...
        [break]

        default:
        ...
        [break]
        }
    </p>

    <p>
        The value of x is checked for a strict equality to the value from the first case (that is, value1) then to the
        second (value2) and so on.
        If the equality is found, switch starts to execute the code starting from the corresponding case, until the
        nearest break (or until the end of switch).
        If no case is matched then the default code is executed (if it exists).
    </p>

    <script>
        let a = 2 + 2;

        switch (a) {
            case 3:
                alert('Too small');
                break;
            case 4:
                alert('Exactly!');
                break;
            case 5:
                alert('Too big');
                break;
            default:
                alert("I don't know such values");
        }
    </script>

    <p>
        Here the switch starts to compare a from the first case variant that is 3. The match fails.

        Then 4. That’s a match, so the execution starts from case 4 until the nearest break.
    </p>
    <p>If there is no break then the execution continues with the next case without any checks.</p>

    <script>
        a = 2 + 2;

        switch (a) {
            case 3:
                alert('Too small');
            case 4:
                alert('Exactly!');
            case 5:
                alert('Too big');
            default:
                alert("I don't know such values");
        }
    </script>

    <p>
        alert( 'Exactly!' );
        alert( 'Too big' );
        alert( "I don't know such values" );
        In the example above we’ll see sequential execution of three alerts:
    </p>


    <p>Any expression can be a switch/case argument</p>

    <script>
        a = "1";
        let b = 0;

        switch (+a) {
            case b + 1:
                alert("this runs, because +a is 1, exactly equals b+1");
                break;

            default:
                alert("this doesn't run");
        }
    </script>
