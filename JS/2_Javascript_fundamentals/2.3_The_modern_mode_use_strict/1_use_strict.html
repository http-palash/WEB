<!-- For a long time, JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues. New features were added to the language while old functionality didn’t change.
That had the benefit of never breaking existing code. But the downside was that any mistake or an imperfect decision made by JavaScript’s creators got stuck in the language forever.
This was the case until 2009 when ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared. It added new features to the language and modified some of the existing ones. To keep the old code working, most such modifications are off by default. You need to explicitly enable them with a special directive: "use strict". -->

<!-- “use strict” -->
<!-- "use strict" can be put at the beginning of a function. Doing that enables strict mode in that function only. 
But usually people use it for the whole script. -->

        alert('Hello');

        // "use strict" below is ignored--it must be at the top
        // "usel strict";
        // strict mode is not activated
    </script>

<!-- There’s no way to cancel use strict
     There is no directive like "no use strict" that reverts the engine to old behavior.
     Once we enter strict mode, there’s no going back. -->

<!-- Should we “use strict”?
     The question may sound obvious, but it’s not so.
    One could recommend to start scripts with "use strict"… But you know what’s cool?

    Modern JavaScript supports “classes” and “modules” – advanced language structures (we’ll surely get to them), that enable use strict automatically. So we don’t need to add the "use strict" directive, if we use them.
    So, for now "use strict"; is a welcome guest at the top of your scripts. Later, when your code is all in classes and modules, you may omit it.
    As of now, we’ve got to know about use strict in general. -->
