    <h1>Functions</h1>

    <p>
        Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.

        For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.

        Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without
        repetition.

        We’ve seen built-in functions, like alert(message), prompt(message, default) and confirm(question).
        But we can create functions of our own as well.
    </p>

    <h1>Function Declaration</h1>

    <script>
        function showMessage() {
            alert('Hello everyone!');
        }   
    </script>

    <p>
        The function keyword goes first, then goes the name of the function, then a list of parameters between the
        parentheses (comma-separated, empty in the example above)
        function name(parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterN) {
        // body
        }
    </p>

    <p>
        Our new function can be called by its name: showMessage().
    </p>

    <script>
        function showMessage() {
            alert('Hello everyone!');
        }

        showMessage();
        showMessage();
    </script>


    <h1>Local variables</h1>
    <p>A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.</p>

    <script>
        function showMessage() {
            let message = "Hello, I'm JavaScript!"; // local variable

            alert(message);
        }

        showMessage(); // Hello, I'm JavaScript!

        alert(message); // <-- Error! The variable is local to the function
    </script>


    <h1>Outer variables</h1>
    <p>A function can access an outer variable as well :</p>
    <script>
        let userName = 'Palash';

        function showMessage() {
            let message = 'Hello, ' + userName;
            alert(message);
        }

        showMessage(); 
    </script>

    <h1>The function has full access to the outer variable. It can modify it as well.</h1>
    <script>
        userName = 'John';

        function showMessage() {
            userName = "Bob"; // (1) changed the outer variable

            let message = 'Hello, ' + userName;
            alert(message);
        }

        alert(userName); // John before the function call

        showMessage();

        alert(userName); // Bob, the value was modified by the function
    </script>

    <h1>The outer variable is only used if there’s no local one.</h1>

    <script>
        userName = 'John';

        function showMessage() {
            let userName = "Bob"; // declare a local variable

            let message = 'Hello, ' + userName; // Bob
            alert(message);
        }

        // the function will create and use its own userName
        showMessage();

        alert(userName); // John, unchanged, the function did not access the outer variable
    </script>

    <h1>
        Global variables
    </h1>
    <p>Variables declared outside of any function, such as the outer userName in the code above, are called global.</p>


    <h1>Parameters</h1>

    <p>
        We can pass arbitrary data to functions using parameters.

        In the example below, the function has two parameters: from and text.
    </p>
    <script>
        function showMessage(from, text) { // parameters: from, text
            alert(from + ': ' + text);
        }

        showMessage('Ann', 'Hello!'); // Ann: Hello! (*)
        showMessage('Ann', "What's up?"); // Ann: What's up? (**)
    </script>

    <p>
        When the function is called in lines (*) and (**), the given values are copied to local variables from and text.
        Then the function uses them.
    </p>

    <script>
        function showMessage(from, text) {

            from = '*' + from + '*'; // make "from" look nicer

            alert(from + ': ' + text);
        }

        let from = "Ann";

        showMessage(from, "Hello"); // *Ann*: Hello

        // the value of "from" is the same, the function modified a local copy
        alert(from); // Ann
    </script>


    <h1>
        Default Values
    </h1>

    <p>
        If a function is called, but an argument is not provided, then the corresponding value becomes undefined.

        For instance, the aforementioned function showMessage(from, text) can be called with a single argument:
    </p>

    <script>
        function showMessage(from, text = "no text given") {
            alert(from + ": " + text);
        }

        showMessage("Ann"); // Ann: no text given
        showMessage("Ann", 2); // Ann: 2
    </script>

    <p>
        He

        <script>
            function showMessage(from, text = anotherFunction()) {
                // anotherFunction() only executed if no text given
                // its result becomes the value of text
            }
        </script>


    <h1>Evaluation of default parameters</h1>
    <p>
        In JavaScript, a default parameter is evaluated every time the function is called without the respective
        parameter.

        In the example above, anotherFunction() isn’t called at all, if the text parameter is provided.

        On the other hand, it’s independently called every time when text is missing.
    </p>

    <h1>Default parameters in old JavaScript code</h1>
    <p>
        Several years ago, JavaScript didn’t support the syntax for default parameters. So people used other ways to
        specify them.

        Nowadays, we can come across them in old scripts.
    </p>

    <script>
        function showMessage(from, text) {
            if (text === undefined) {
                text = 'no text given';
            }

            alert(from + ": " + text);
        }
    </script>

    <p>Or we could use the || operator:</p>

    <script>
        function showMessage(text) {
            // if text is undefined or otherwise falsy, set it to 'empty'
            text = text || 'empty';

        }
    </script>

    <p>
        Modern JavaScript engines support the nullish coalescing operator ??, it’s better when most falsy values, such
        as 0, should be considered “normal”:
    </p>


    <script>
        function showCount(count) {
            // if count is undefined or null, show "unknown"
            alert(count ?? "unknown");
        }

        showCount(0); // 0
        showCount(null); // unknown
        showCount(); // unknown
    </script>


    <h1>Returning a value</h1>
    <p>A function can return a value back into the calling code as the result.</p>


    <script>
        function sum(a, b) {
            return a + b;
        }

        let result = sum(1, 2);
        alert(result); // 3
    </script>

    <p>
        The directive return can be in any place of the function. When the execution reaches it, the function stops, and
        the value is returned to the calling code (assigned to result above).
    </p>

    <p>
        There may be many occurrences of return in a single function. For instance:
    </p>

    <script>
        function checkAge(age) {
            if (age >= 18) {
                return true;
            } else {
                return confirm('Do you have permission from your parents?');
            }
        }

        let age = prompt('How old are you?', 18);

        if (checkAge(age)) {
            alert('Access granted');
        } else {
            alert('Access denied');
        }
    </script>

    <p>
        It is possible to use return without a value. That causes the function to exit immediately.
    </p>

    <script>
        function showMovie(age) {
            if (!checkAge(age)) {
                return;
            }

            alert("Showing you the movie"); // (*)
            // ...
        }
        // In the code above, if checkAge(age) returns false, then showMovie won’t proceed to the alert.
    </script>

    <h1>A function with an empty return or without it returns undefined</h1>
    <p>
        If a function does not return a value, it is the same as if it returns undefined:
    </p>

    <script>
        function doNothing() { /* empty */ }
        alert(doNothing() === undefined); // true
    </script>

    <p>
        An empty return is also the same as return undefined:
    </p>
    <script>
        function doNothing() {
            return;
        }

        alert(doNothing() === undefined); // true
    </script>

    <h1>Never add a newline between return and the value</h1>
    <p>
        return
        (some + long + expression + or + whatever * f(a) + f(b))
        That doesn’t work, because JavaScript assumes a semicolon after return. That’ll work the same as:
        return;
        (some + long + expression + or + whatever * f(a) + f(b))
    </p>

    <p>
        So, it effectively becomes an empty return.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we want the returned expression to wrap across multiple lines, we should start it at the same line as return.
        Or at least put the opening parentheses there as follows:
    </p>

    <script>
        return (
            some + long + expression
            + or +
            whatever * f(a) + f(b)
        )
    </script>


    <h1>Naming a function</h1>


    <p>
        Functions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe
        what the function does, so that someone reading the code gets an indication of what the function does.

        It is a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. There
        must be an agreement within the team on the meaning of the prefixes.

        For instance, functions that start with "show" usually show something.

        Function starting with…

        "get…" – return a value,
        "calc…" – calculate something,
        "create…" – create something,
        "check…" – check something and return a boolean, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        With prefixes in place, a glance at a function name gives an understanding what kind of work it does and what
        kind of value it returns.
    </p>

    <h1>
        One function – one action
    </h1>
    <p>
        A function should do exactly what is suggested by its name, no more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Two independent actions usually deserve two functions, even if they are usually called together (in that case we
        can make a 3rd function that calls those two).
    </p>

    <p>
        A few examples of breaking this rule:

        getAge – would be bad if it shows an alert with the age (should only get).
        createForm – would be bad if it modifies the document, adding a form to it (should only create it and return).
        checkPermission – would be bad if it displays the access granted/denied message (should only perform the check
        and return the result).
    </p>

    <h1>Ultrashort function names</h1>
    <p>
        Functions that are used very often sometimes have ultrashort names.

        For example, the jQuery framework defines a function with $. The Lodash library has its core function named _.

        These are exceptions. Generally function names should be concise and descriptive.
    </p>


    <h1>Functions == Comments</h1>
    <p>
        Functions should be short and do exactly one thing. If that thing is big, maybe it’s worth it to split the
        function into a few smaller functions. Sometimes following this rule may not be that easy, but it’s definitely a
        good thing.
    </p>

    <p>
        A separate function is not only easier to test and debug – its very existence is a great comment!
    </p>

    <p>
        For instance, compare the two functions showPrimes(n) below. Each one outputs prime numbers up to n.
    </p>

    <script>

        // The first variant uses a label:
        let n = 100;
        function showPrimes(n) {
            nextPrime: for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {

                for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) {
                    if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime;
                }

                alert(i); // a prime
            }
        }
        // The second variant uses an additional function isPrime(n) to test for primality:
        n = 100;
        function showPrimes(n) {

            for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
                if (!isPrime(i)) continue;

                alert(i);  // a prime
            }
        }

        function isPrime(n) {
            for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
                if (n % i == 0) return false;
            }
            return true;
        }
    </script>

    <h1>ummary</h1>
    <p>
        A function declaration looks like this:
        function name(parameters, delimited, by, comma) {
            /* code */
          }
    </p>
    <p>
        Values passed to a function as parameters are copied to its local variables.
        A function may access outer variables. But it works only from inside out. The code outside of the function doesn’t see its local variables.
        A function can return a value. If it doesn’t, then its result is undefined.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make the code clean and easy to understand, it’s recommended to use mainly local variables and parameters in the function, not outer variables.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is always easier to understand a function which gets parameters, works with them and returns a result than a function which gets no parameters, but modifies outer variables as a side effect.
    </p>

    <h1>Function naming:</h1>
    <p>
        A name should clearly describe what the function does. When we see a function call in the code, a good name instantly gives us an understanding what it does and returns.
A function is an action, so function names are usually verbal.
There exist many well-known function prefixes like create…, show…, get…, check… and so on. Use them to hint what a function does.
