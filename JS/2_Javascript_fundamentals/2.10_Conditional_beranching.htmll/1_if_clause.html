    <h1>Conditional branching: if, '?'</h1>
    <p>Sometimes, we need to perform different actions based on different conditions.

        To do that, we can use the if statement and the conditional operator ?, that’s also called a “question mark”
        operator.</p>

    <h3>The “if” statement</h3>
    <p>The if(...) statement evaluates a condition in parentheses and, if the result is true, executes a block of code.
    </p>
    <script>
        let year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');
        if (year == 2015) alert('You are right!');
    </script>

    <p>If we want to execute more than one statement, we have to wrap our code block inside curly braces:</p>

    <script>
        if (year == 2015) {
            alert("That's correct!");
            alert("You're so smart!");
        }
    </script>

    <p>
        wrapping your code block with curly braces {} every time you use an if statement, even if there is only one
        statement to execute. Doing so improves readability.
    </p>

    <h1>Boolean conversion</h1>


    <p>
        The if (…) statement evaluates the expression in its parentheses and converts the result to a boolean.

        Let’s recall the conversion rules from the chapter Type Conversions:

        A number 0, an empty string "", null, undefined, and NaN all become false. Because of that they are called
        “falsy” values.
        Other values become true, so they are called “truthy”.
        So, the code under this condition would never execute:
    </p>

    <script>
        if (0) { // 0 is falsy
  
        }
        if (1) { // 1 is truthy
  
        }

        let cond = (year == 2015); // equality evaluates to true or false

        if (cond) {

        }
    </script>
</body>
