        The “null” value
    </h1>

    <p>
        The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.
        It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:     
    </p>

    <script>
        let age = null;
        console.log(age);
    </script>

    <p>
        In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.
        It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.
        The code above states that age is unknown.
