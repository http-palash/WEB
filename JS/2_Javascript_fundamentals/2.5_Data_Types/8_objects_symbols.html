        Objects and Symbols
    </h1>

    <p>
        The object type is special.
        All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
        Being that important, objects deserve a special treatment
    </p>

    <p>
        The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.
