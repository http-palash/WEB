        The “undefined” value
    </h1>
    <p>
        The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.

        The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.

        If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:
    </p>

    <script>
        let age;
        alert(age); // shows "undefined"
        age = 100;
        alert(age); // shows 100
        // change the value to undefined
        age = undefined;
        alert(age); // "undefined"
    </script>
    
    <p>
        Normally, one uses null to assign an “empty” or “unknown” value to a variable, while undefined is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.
