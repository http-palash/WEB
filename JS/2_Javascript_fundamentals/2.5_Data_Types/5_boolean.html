         <p>
            The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

            This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.

            For instance:
        </p>

        <script>
            let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
            let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked
            console.log(nameFieldChecked);
            console.log(ageFieldChecked);
        </script>

        <p>Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons:</p>
        
        <script>
            let isGreater = 4 > 1;
            alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")
        </script>
