    <h1>Number</h1>
        
        <script>
            let n = 123;
            n = 12.345;
        </script>

        <p>
            The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
            There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.
            Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.
        </p>

        <p>
            Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number.
            We can get it as a result of division by zero:
            Or just reference it directly:
        </p>

        <script>
            alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity
            alert( Infinity ); // Infinity
        </script>

        <p>
            NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for instance:
        </p>

        <script>
            alert( "not a number" / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous
        </script>

        <!-- Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them. -->

        <p>
            NaN is sticky. Any further mathematical operation on NaN returns NaN:
        </p>

        <script>
            alert( NaN + 1 ); // NaN
            alert( 3 * NaN ); // NaN
            alert( "not a number" / 2 - 1 ); // NaN
        </script>

        <p>
            So, if there’s a NaN somewhere in a mathematical expression, it propagates to the whole result (there’s only one exception to that: NaN ** 0 is 1).
        </p>

        <p>
            Mathematical operations are safe
            Doing maths is “safe” in JavaScript. We can do anything: divide by zero, treat non-numeric strings as numbers, etc.

            The script will never stop with a fatal error (“die”). At worst, we’ll get NaN as the result.
        </p>
        </script>
