    <title>Datatypes in JS</title>
</head>

    <p>
        A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.
        There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. Here, we’ll cover them in general and in the next chapters we’ll talk about each of them in detail.
        We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a number:
    </p>

    <script>
       // no error
        let message = "hello";
        message = 123456;

        // Number
        // The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
        let n = 123;
        n = 12.345;
        </script>
