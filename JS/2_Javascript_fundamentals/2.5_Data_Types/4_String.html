        A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
    </h1>

    <p>
        In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.
        Double quotes: "Hello".
        Single quotes: 'Hello'.
        Backticks: `Hello`.
    </p>

    <p>Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.</p>
    <p>ackticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example:</p>


    <script>
        let str = "Hello";
        let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too ${str}';
        let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;

        console.log(str);
        console.log(str2);
        console.log(phrase);
    </script>

    <script>
        let name = "Palash";
        // let str = "error";
        // embed a variable
        alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, John!

        // embed an expression
        alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); // the result is 3
    </script>

    <p>
        There is no character type.
        In some languages, there is a special “character” type for a single character. For example, in the C language and in Java it is called “char”.
        In JavaScript, there is no such type. There’s only one type: string. A string may consist of zero characters (be empty), one character or many of them.
