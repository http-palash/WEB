    <h1>Comparisons
    </h1>


    <p>

        We know many comparison operators from maths.

        In JavaScript they are written like this:

        Greater/less than: a > b, a < b. Greater/less than or equals: a>= b, a <= b. Equals: a==b, please note the
                double equality sign==means the equality test, while a single one a=b means an assignment. Not equals:
                In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as a !=b. In this article we’ll learn more
                about different types of comparisons, how JavaScript makes them, including important peculiarities. </p>



                <h1>Boolean is the result</h1>

                <p>
                    All comparison operators return a boolean value:

                    true – means “yes”, “correct” or “the truth”.
                    false – means “no”, “wrong” or “not the truth”.
                </p>

                <script>
                    alert(2 > 1);  // true (correct)
                    alert(2 == 1); // false (wrong)
                    alert(2 != 1); // true (correct)
                </script>

                <p>A comparison result can be assigned to a variable, just like any value:</p>

                <script>
                    let result = 5 > 4; // assign the result of the comparison
                    alert(result); // true
                </script>

                <h1>String comparison</h1>
                <p>
                    To see whether a string is greater than another, JavaScript uses the so-called “dictionary” or
                    “lexicographical” order.

                    In other words, strings are compared letter-by-letter.
                </p>

                <script>
                    alert('Z' > 'A'); // true
                    alert('Glow' > 'Glee'); // true
                    alert('Bee' > 'Be'); // true
                </script>

                <p>
                    The algorithm to compare two strings is simple:

                    Compare the first character of both strings.
                    If the first character from the first string is greater (or less) than the other string’s, then the
                    first string is greater (or less) than the second. We’re done.
                    Otherwise, if both strings’ first characters are the same, compare the second characters the same
                    way.
                    Repeat until the end of either string.
                    If both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. Otherwise, the longer string is
                    greater.
                </p>


                <p>
                    In the first example above, the comparison 'Z' > 'A' gets to a result at the first step.

                    The second comparison 'Glow' and 'Glee' needs more steps as strings are compared
                    character-by-character:

                    G is the same as G.
                    l is the same as l.
                    o is greater than e. Stop here. The first string is greater.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the first example above, the comparison 'Z' > 'A' gets to a result at the first step.

                    l is the same as l.
                    o is greater than e. Stop here. The first string is greater.
                </p>

                <h1>Comparison of different types</h1>

                <h4>When comparing values of different types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers.</h4>

                <script>
                    alert('2' > 1); // true, string '2' becomes a number 2
                    alert('01' == 1); // true, string '01' becomes a number 1
                </script>

                <h4>For boolean values, true becomes 1 and false becomes 0.</h4>

                <script>
                    alert(true == 1); // true
                    alert(false == 0); // true
                </script>

                <h1>A funny consequence</h1>

                <p>
                    It is possible that at the same time:

                    Two values are equal.
                    One of them is true as a boolean and the other one is false as a boolean.
                </p>

                <script>
                    let a = 0;
                    alert(Boolean(a)); // false

                    let b = "0";
                    alert(Boolean(b)); // true

                    alert(a == b); // true!
                </script>

                <p>
                    From JavaScript’s standpoint, this result is quite normal. An equality check converts values using
                    the numeric conversion (hence "0" becomes 0), while the explicit Boolean conversion uses another set
                    of rules.
                </p>
                <h1>Strict equality</h1>
                <p>A regular equality check == has a problem. It cannot differentiate 0 from false:</p>

                <script>
                    alert(0 == false); // true
                    alert('' == false); // true
                </script>

                <p>
                    This happens because operands of different types are converted to numbers by the equality operator
                    ==. An empty string, just like false, becomes a zero.

                    What to do if we’d like to differentiate 0 from false?

                    A strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion.

                    In other words, if a and b are of different types, then a === b immediately returns false without an
                    attempt to convert them.
                </p>
                <script>
                    alert(0 === false); // false, because the types are different
                </script>

                <p>
                    There is also a “strict non-equality” operator !== analogous to !=.

                    The strict equality operator is a bit longer to write, but makes it obvious what’s going on and
                    leaves less room for errors.
                </p>

                <h1>Comparison with null and undefined</h1>
                <p>
                    There’s a non-intuitive behavior when null or undefined are compared to other values.

                    For a strict equality check ===
                    These values are different, because each of them is a different type.
                </p>

                <script>
                    alert(null === undefined); // false
                </script>

                <p>For a non-strict check ==
                    There’s a special rule. These two are a “sweet couple”: they equal each other (in the sense of ==),
                    but not any other value.</p>

                <script>
                    alert(null == undefined); // true
                </script>

                <p>For maths and other comparisons <>
                        <=>=
                            null/undefined are converted to numbers: null becomes 0, while undefined becomes NaN.</p>

                <h1>Strange result: null vs 0</h1>
                <script>
                    alert(null > 0);  // (1) false
                    alert(null == 0); // (2) false
                    alert(null >= 0); // (3) true
                </script>

                <p>
                    Mathematically, that's strange. The last result states that "null is greater than or equal to zero",
                    so in one of the comparisons above it must be true, but they are both false.

                    The reason is that an equality check == and comparisons > <>= <= work differently. Comparisons
                            convert null to a number, treating it as 0. That’s why (3) null>= 0 is true and (1) null > 0
                            is false.

                            On the other hand, the equality check == for undefined and null is defined such that,
                            without any conversions, they equal each other and don’t equal anything else. That’s why (2)
                            null == 0 is false.
                </p>

                <h1>An incomparable undefined</h1>
                <p>The value undefined shouldn’t be compared to other values:</p>

                <script>
                    alert(undefined > 0); // false (1)
                    alert(undefined < 0); // false (2)
                    alert(undefined == 0); // false (3)
                </script>
                <p>
                    Why does it dislike zero so much? Always false!

                    We get these results because:

                    Comparisons (1) and (2) return false because undefined gets converted to NaN and NaN is a special
                    numeric value which returns false for all comparisons.
                    The equality check (3) returns false because undefined only equals null, undefined, and no other
                    value.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Avoid problems
                    Why did we go over these examples? Should we remember these peculiarities all the time? Well, not
                    really. Actually, these tricky things will gradually become familiar over time, but there’s a solid
                    way to avoid problems with them:

                    Treat any comparison with undefined/null except the strict equality === with exceptional care.
                    Don’t use comparisons >= > < <=with a variable which may be null/undefined, unless you’re really
                        sure of what you’re doing. If a variable can have these values, check for them separately. </p>

                        <p>
                            Summary
                            Comparison operators return a boolean value.
                            Strings are compared letter-by-letter in the “dictionary” order.
                            When values of different types are compared, they get converted to numbers (with the
                            exclusion of a strict equality check).
                            The values null and undefined equal == each other and do not equal any other value.
                            Be careful when using comparisons like > or < with variables that can occasionally be
                                null/undefined. Checking for null/undefined separately is a good idea. </p>


                <script>
                    //                     5 > 4 → true
                    // "apple" > "pineapple" → false
                    // "2" > "12" → true
                    // undefined == null → true
                    // undefined === null → false
                    // null == "\n0\n" → false
                    // null === +"\n0\n" → false
                </script>
                
                <p>
                    Some of the reasons:
                
                    Obviously, true.
                    Dictionary comparison, hence false. "a" is smaller than "p".
                    Again, dictionary comparison, first char "2" is greater than the first char "1".
                    Values null and undefined equal each other only.
                    Strict equality is strict. Different types from both sides lead to false.
                    Similar to (4), null only equals undefined.
                    Strict equality of different types.
                </p>
