    <h1>Type Conversions</h1>

    <p>
        Most of the time, operators and functions automatically convert the values given to them to the right type.
        For example, alert automatically converts any value to a string to show it. Mathematical operations convert
        values to numbers.
        There are also cases when we need to explicitly convert a value to the expected type.
    </p>

    <h1>String Conversion</h1>
    <p>
        String conversion happens when we need the string form of a value.
        For example, alert(value) does it to show the value.
        We can also call the String(value) function to convert a value to a string:
    </p>

    <script>
        let value = true;
        alert(typeof value); // boolean

        value = String(value); // now value is a string "true"
        alert(typeof value); // string
    </script>

    <p>String conversion is mostly obvious. A false becomes "false", null becomes "null", etc.</p>

    <h1>Numeric Conversion</h1>
    <p>
        Numeric conversion in mathematical functions and expressions happens automatically.

        For example, when division / is applied to non-numbers:
    </p>

    <script>
        alert("6" / "2"); // 3, strings are converted to numbers
    </script>

    <p>
        We can use the Number(value) function to explicitly convert a value to a number:
    </p>

    <script>
        let str = "123";
        alert(typeof str); // string
        let num = Number(str); // becomes a number 123
        alert(typeof num); // number
    </script>


    <p>
        Explicit conversion is usually required when we read a value from a string-based source like a text form but
        expect a number to be entered.

        If the string is not a valid number, the result of such a conversion is NaN. For instance:
    </p>

    <script>
        let age = Number("an arbitrary string instead of a number");

        alert(age); // NaN, conversion failed
    </script>

    <p>
    <h2> Numeric conversion rules:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Value</th>
                    <th> Becomes…</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>undefined</td>
                    <td>NaN</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>null</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>true and false</td>
                    <td>1 and 0</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>string</td>
                    <td> Whitespaces (includes spaces, tabs \t, newlines \n etc.) from the start and end are removed. If
                        the remaining string is empty, the result is 0. Otherwise, the number is “read” from the string.
                        An error gives NaN.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        </p>

        <script>
            alert(Number("   123   ")); // 123
            alert(Number("123z"));      // NaN (error reading a number at "z")
            alert(Number(true));        // 1
            alert(Number(false));       // 0
        </script>
        <p>
            Please note that null and undefined behave differently here: null becomes zero while undefined becomes NaN.

            Most mathematical operators also perform such conversion, we’ll see that in the next chapter.
        </p>

        <h1>Boolean Conversion</h1>

        <p>
            Boolean conversion is the simplest one.

            It happens in logical operations (later we’ll meet condition tests and other similar things) but can also be
            performed explicitly with a call to Boolean(value).

            The conversion rule:

            Values that are intuitively “empty”, like 0, an empty string, null, undefined, and NaN, become false.
            Other values become true.
        </p>

        <script>
            alert(Boolean(1)); // true
            alert(Boolean(0)); // false

            alert(Boolean("hello")); // true
            alert(Boolean("")); // false
        </script>

        <p>Please note: the string with zero "0" is true</p>
        <p>Some languages (namely PHP CPP) treat "0" as false. But in JavaScript, a non-empty string is always true.</p>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>

            The three most widely used type conversions are to string, to number, and to boolean.

            String Conversion – Occurs when we output something. Can be performed with String(value). The conversion to
            string is usually obvious for primitive values.

            Numeric Conversion – Occurs in math operations. Can be performed with Number(value).

            Boolean Conversion – Occurs in logical operations. Can be performed with Boolean(value).
