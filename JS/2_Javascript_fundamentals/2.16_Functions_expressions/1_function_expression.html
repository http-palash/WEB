    <h1>Function expressions</h1>
    <p>
        In JavaScript, a function is not a “magical language structure”, but a special kind of value.

The syntax that we used before is called a Function Declaration:        
    </p>

    <script>
        // function sayHi() {
        // alert( "sayHi Hello function" );
        // }
    </script>

    <p>
        There is another syntax for creating a function that is called a Function Expression.
        It allows us to create a new function in the middle of any expression.
    </p>

    <script>
        let sayHi = function() {
         alert( "Hello hi value function" );
        };
    </script>
    <p>

        Here we can see a variable sayHi getting a value, the new function, created as function() { alert("Hello"); }.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the function creation happens in the context of the assignment expression (to the right side of =), this is a Function Expression.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note, there’s no name after the function keyword. Omitting a name is allowed for Function Expressions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here we immediately assign it to the variable, so the meaning of these code samples is the same: "create a function and put it into the variable sayHi".
    </p>

    <p>
        In more advanced situations, that we’ll come across later, a function may be created and immediately called or scheduled for a later execution, not stored anywhere, thus remaining anonymous.
    </p>

        
    <h1>Function is a value</h1>
    <p>
        no matter how the function is created, a function is a value. Both prev examples store a function in the sayHi variable.
    </p>

    <script>
        // function sayHi() {
        //      alert( "Hello" );
        // }
        sayHi(); 

        // But

        alert( sayHi ); // shows the function code
        // function() {
        //  alert( "Hello" );
        // }; this will be output
    </script>

    <p>
        Please note that the last line does not run the function, because there are no parentheses after sayHi. There are programming languages where any mention of a function name causes its execution, but JavaScript is not like that.
    </p>

    <p>
        In JavaScript, a function is a value, so we can deal with it as a value. The code above shows its string representation, which is the source code.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        a function is a special value, in the sense that we can call it like sayHi().
        But it’s still a value. So we can work with it like with other kinds of values.
        We can copy a function to another variable:
    </p>
    <script>
        let func = sayHi;
        sayHi();
        func();
    </script>

    <p>
        Here’s what happens above in detail:

        1.The Function Declaration (1) creates the function and puts it into the variable named sayHi.
        2.Line (2) copies it into the variable func. Please note again: there are no parentheses after sayHi. If there were, then func = sayHi() would write the result of the call sayHi() into func, not the function sayHi itself.
        3.Now the function can be called as both sayHi() and func().
    </p>

    <h1>Why is there a semicolon at the end?</h1>

    <script>
                function sayHi() {
        // ...
        }

        let sayHi = function() {
        // ...
        };
    </script>
    <p>
        The answer is simple: a Function Expression is created here as function(…) {…} inside the assignment statement: let sayHi = …;. The semicolon ; is recommended at the end of the statement, it’s not a part of the function syntax.
        The semicolon would be there for a simpler assignment, such as let sayHi = 5;, and it’s also there for a function assignment.
