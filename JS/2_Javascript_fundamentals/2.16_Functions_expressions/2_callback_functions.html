    <h1>Recap func expressions</h1>
    <p>
        As the function creation happens in the context of the assignment expression 
        (to the right side of =), 
        this is a Function Expression.
        Omitting a name is allowed for Function Expressions.
        create a function and put it into the variable.
    </p>


    <script>
        // let temp = function(){
        //     alert('Hello');
        // };
        // //  Function Expression is created here as function(…) {…} inside the assignment statement: let sayHi = …;. The semicolon ; is recommended at the end of the statement, it’s not a part of the function syntax.
        // let r = temp;
        // r();
        // temp();
    </script>

    <h1>Callback functions</h1>
    <p>A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.</p>
    <p>write a function ask(question, yes, no) with three parameters:</p>
    <p>The function should ask the question and, depending on the user’s answer, call yes() or no():</p>


    <script>

        // function ask(question,yes,no){
        //     if(confirm(question)) yes()
        //     else no()
        // }

        // function showOk(){
        //     alert("You agreed");
        // }

        // function showCancel(){
        //     alert("You canceled the execution");
        // }

        // ask("Do you agree?",showOk(),showCancel());
        

    </script>

    <p>
        The arguments showOk and showCancel of ask are called callback functions or just callbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea is that we pass a function and expect it to be “called back” later if necessary. In our case, showOk becomes the callback for “yes” answer, and showCancel for “no” answer.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can use Function Expressions to write an equivalent, shorter function:
    </p>

    <script>
        function ask(question,yes,no){
            if(confirm(question)) yes()
            else no();
        }

        ask("Do you agree",
            function(){alert("You agreed yes")},
            function(){alert("You canceled the execution");}
        );

        // Here, functions are declared right inside the ask(...) call. They have no name, and so are called anonymous. Such functions are not accessible outside of ask (because they are not assigned to variables), but that’s just what we want here.
        // Such code appears in our scripts very naturally, it’s in the spirit of JavaScript.
    </script>

    <h1>A function is a value representing an “action”</h1>
    <p>
        Regular values like strings or numbers represent the data.
        A function can be perceived as an action.
        We can pass it between variables and run when we want.
    </p>
