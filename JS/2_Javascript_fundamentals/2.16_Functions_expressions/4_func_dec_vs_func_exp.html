        What can we do to make welcome visible outside of if?
    </p>
    <p>
        The correct approach would be to use a Function Expression and assign welcome to the variable that is declared outside of if and has the proper visibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        This code works as intended:
    </p>

    <script>
        let ag = prompt("enter age: ",'1');
        let welcome;

        if(ag < 18){
            welcome = function(){
                alert("Hello");
            };
        }else{
            welcome = function(){
                alert("Greetings");
            };
        }
        welcome();
    </script>

    <p>Or we could simplify it even further using a question mark operator ?:</p>
    <script>
        let age = prompt("Enter you age:",'18');

        let wel = age < 18 ?
        function(){alert("Hello hi")}:
        function(){alert("Greetinngs")};

        wel();
    </script>
