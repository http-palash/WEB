    <h1>Function Expression vs Function Declaration</h1>
    <p>
        Function Declaration: a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow:
        // Function Declaration
        function sum(a, b) {
        return a + b;
        }
    </p>
    <h1>
        // Function Expression
        let sum = function(a, b) {
        return a + b;
        };
    </h1>

    <script>
        let sum = function (a, b) {
            //   return a + b;
            alert("Sum is : " + (a + b));
        };
        let a = +prompt("Enter a:", '');
        let b = +prompt("Enter b: ", '');

        let n = sum;

        n(a, b);
    </script>

    <h1>A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.</h1>

    <h1> Function Declarations are different. A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.</h1>
    <h2>a global Function Declaration is visible in the whole script, no matter where it is.</h2>
    <h3>That’s due to internal algorithms. When JavaScript prepares to run the script, it first looks for global
        Function Declarations in it and creates the functions. We can think of it as an “initialization stage”.</h3>
    <h4>And after all Function Declarations are processed, the code is executed. So it has access to these functions.
    </h4>

    <script>
        // sayHi("John"); // Hello, John

        // function sayHi(name) {
        // alert( `Hello, ${name}` );
        // }
    </script>

    <h1>The Function Declaration sayHi is created when JavaScript is preparing to start the script and is visible
        everywhere in it.

        …If it were a Function Expression, then it wouldn’t work:</h1>

    <script>

        sayHi("John"); // error!
        //     3_function_declarati…declaration.html: 59
        // Uncaught
        // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'sayHi' before initialization
        let sayHi = function (name) {  // (*) no magic any more
            alert(`Hello, ${name}`);
        };
        // sayHi("John"); // not error
    </script>

    <p>Function Expressions are created when the execution reaches them. That would happen only in the line (</p>
    <p>Another special feature of Function Declarations is their block scope.</p>
    <p>In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, it’s visible everywhere inside that block.
        But not outside of it.</p>

    <p>
        For instance, let’s imagine that we need to declare a function welcome() depending on the age variable that we
        get during runtime. And then we plan to use it some time later.

        If we use Function Declaration, it won’t work as intended:
    </p>

    <script>
        let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

        // conditionally declare a function
        if (age < 18) {

            function welcome() {
                alert("Hello!");
            }

        } else {

            function welcome() {
                alert("Greetings!");
            }

        }

        // ...use it later
        welcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined
    </script>

    <script>
        age = 16; // take 16 as an example

        if (age < 18) {
            welcome();                // \   (runs)
                                     //  |
            function welcome() {     //  |
                alert("Hello!");     //  |  Function Declaration is available
            }                        //  |  everywhere in the block where it's declared
                                     //  |
            welcome();               // /   (runs)

        } else {

            function welcome() {
                alert("Greetings!");
            }
        }

        // Here we're out of curly braces,
        // so we can not see Function Declarations made inside of them.

        welcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined
    </script>

<!-- 
1.function expression cannot be called earlier
2.function declaration can be called earlier
3.In strict code scope of function declaration is only in its block
  That’s because a Function Declaration is only visible inside the code block in which it resides.
