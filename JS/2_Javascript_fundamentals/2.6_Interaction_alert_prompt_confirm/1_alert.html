    <h2>It shows a message and waits for the user to press “OK”.</h2>

    <script>
        alert("Hello");
    </script>

    <p>
        The mini-window with the message is called a modal window. The word “modal” means that the visitor can’t interact with the rest of the page, press other buttons, etc, until they have dealt with the window. In this case – until they press “OK”.
