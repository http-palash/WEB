    <h1>OR</h1>
    <script>
        alert(true || true);   // true
        alert(false || true);  // true
        alert(true || false);  // true
        alert(false || false); // false
    </script>

    <p>If an operand is not a boolean, it’s converted to a boolean for the evaluation.

        For instance, the number 1 is treated as true, the number 0 as false:</p>
    <script>
        if (1 || 0) { // works just like if( true || false )
            alert('truthy!');
        }
    </script>

    <p>Most of the time, OR || is used in an if statement to test if any of the given conditions is true.</p>

    <script>
        let hour = 9;

        if (hour < 10 || hour > 18) {
            alert('The office is closed.');
        }
    </script>

    <p>We can pass more conditions:</p>
    <script>
        hour = 12;
        let isWeekend = true;

        if (hour < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend) {
            alert('The office is closed.'); // it is the weekend
        }
    </script>

    <h1>OR "||" finds the first truthy value</h1>
    <p>
        The logic described above is somewhat classical. Now, let’s bring in the “extra” features of JavaScript.

        The extended algorithm works as follows.

        Given multiple OR’ed values:

        result = value1 || value2 || value3;
    </p>

    <p>
        The OR || operator does the following:

        Evaluates operands from left to right.
        For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is true, stops and returns the original value of that
        operand.
        If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand.
        A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.

        In other words, a chain of OR || returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.
    </p>

    <script>
        alert( 1 || 0 ); // 1 (1 is truthy)

alert( null || 1 ); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
alert( null || 0 || 1 ); // 1 (the first truthy value)

alert( undefined || null || 0 ); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)
    </script>

    <h1>Getting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions.</h1>


    <script>
        let firstName = "";
let lastName = "";
let nickName = "SuperCoder";

alert( firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // SuperCoder
    </script>

    <h1>Short-circuit evaluation.</h1>

    <p>
        It means that || processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the other argument.
    </p>

    <script>
        true || alert("not printed");
        false || alert("printed");
    </script>

    <p>In the first line, the OR || operator stops the evaluation immediately upon seeing true, so the alert isn’t run.</p>
