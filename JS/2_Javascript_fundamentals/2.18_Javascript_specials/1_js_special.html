    <h1>Recap of this repo</h1>

    <h2>Code structure</h2>
    <script>
        alert('Hello');
        alert('World');
    </script>

    <h2>Usually, a line-break is also treated as a delimiter, so that would also work:</h2>
    <script>
        alert('Hello')
        alert('World')
    </script>

    <h2>
        That’s called “automatic semicolon insertion”. Sometimes it doesn’t work, for instance:
    </h2>

    <script>
        alert("There will be an error after this message because of no termination / semicolon")

        [1, 2].forEach(alert)
    </script>

    <p>
      We should put a semicolon after each statement.

        Semicolons are not required after code blocks {...} and syntax constructs with them like loops:
    </p>

    <p>
        function f() {
        // no semicolon needed after function declaration
        }

        for(;;) {
        // no semicolon needed after the loop
        }

        …But even if we can put an “extra” semicolon somewhere, that’s not an error. It will be ignored.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Strict mode
        To fully enable all features of modern JavaScript, we should start scripts with "use strict".
    </h2>

    <script>
        'use strict';
    </script>

    <p>
        The directive must be at the top of a script or at the beginning of a function body.

        Without "use strict", everything still works, but some features behave in the old-fashioned, “compatible” way.
        We’d generally prefer the modern behavior.

        Some modern features of the language like classes enable strict mode implicitly.
    </p>

    <h1>Variables</h1>

    <p>
        Can be declared using:
        let
        const (constant, can’t be changed)
        var (old-style)
    </p>


    <p>
        A variable name can include:

        Letters and digits, but the first character may not be a digit.
        Characters $ and _ are normal, on par with letters.
        Non-Latin alphabets and hieroglyphs are also allowed, but commonly not used.
        Variables are dynamically typed. They can store any value:
    </p>

    <script>
        let x = 5;
        x = "John";
    </script>


    <p>
        There are 8 data types:

        number for both floating-point and integer numbers,
        bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length,
        string for strings,
        boolean for logical values: true/false,
        null – a type with a single value null, meaning “empty” or “does not exist”,
        undefined – a type with a single value undefined, meaning “not assigned”,
        object and symbol – for complex data structures and unique identifiers;
    </p>

    <p>
        The typeof operator returns the type for a value, with two exceptions:
    </p>

    <script>
        typeof null == "object" // error in the language
        typeof function () { } == "function" // functions are treated specially
    </script>


    <h1>
        Interaction
    </h1>

    <p>
        We’re using a browser as a working environment, so basic UI functions will be:

        prompt(question, [default])
        Ask a question, and return either what the visitor entered or null if they clicked “cancel”.
        confirm(question)
        Ask a question and suggest to choose between Ok and Cancel. The choice is returned as true/false.
        alert(message)
        Output a message.
        All these functions are modal, they pause the code execution and prevent the visitor from interacting with the
        page until they answer.
    </p>


    <script>
        let userName = prompt("Your name?", "Alice");
        let isTeaWanted = confirm("Do you want some tea?");

        alert("Visitor: " + userName); // Alice
        alert("Tea wanted: " + isTeaWanted); // true
    </script>


    <h1>Operators</h1>

    <p>
        JavaScript supports the following operators:

        Arithmetical
        Regular: * + - /, also % for the remainder and ** for power of a number.

        The binary plus + concatenates strings. And if any of the operands is a string, the other one is converted to
        string too:

        alert( '1' + 2 ); // '12', string
        alert( 1 + '2' ); // '12', string
        Assignments
        There is a simple assignment: a = b and combined ones like a *= 2.

        Bitwise
        Bitwise operators work with 32-bit integers at the lowest, bit-level: see the docs when they are needed.

        Conditional
        The only operator with three parameters: cond ? resultA : resultB. If cond is truthy, returns resultA, otherwise
        resultB.

        Logical operators
        Logical AND && and OR || perform short-circuit evaluation and then return the value where it stopped (not
        necessary true/false). Logical NOT ! converts the operand to boolean type and returns the inverse value.

        Nullish coalescing operator
        The ?? operator provides a way to choose a defined value from a list of variables. The result of a ?? b is a
        unless it’s null/undefined, then b.

        Comparisons
        Equality check == for values of different types converts them to a number (except null and undefined that equal
        each other and nothing else), so these are equal:

        alert( 0 == false ); // true
        alert( 0 == '' ); // true
    </p>

    <p>
        Other comparisons convert to a number as well.

        The strict equality operator === doesn’t do the conversion: different types always mean different values for it.

        Values null and undefined are special: they equal == each other and don’t equal anything else.

        Greater/less comparisons compare strings character-by-character, other types are converted to a number.

        Other operators
        There are few others, like a comma operator.

        More in: Basic operators, maths, Comparisons, Logical operators, Nullish coalescing operator '??'.

    <h1>loops</h1>

    <p>
        We covered 3 types of loops:

        // 1
        while (condition) {
        ...
        }

        // 2
        do {
        ...
        } while (condition);

        // 3
        for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        ...
        }

        The variable declared in for(let...) loop is visible only inside the loop. But we can also omit let and reuse an existing variable.

        Directives break/continue allow to exit the whole loop/current iteration. Use labels to break nested loops.
        
    </p>

    <h1>The “switch” construct</h1>
    <p>
        The “switch” construct can replace multiple if checks. It uses === (strict equality) for comparisons.
    </p>

    <p>
        let age = prompt('Your age?', 18);

        switch (age) {
        case 18:
            alert("Won't work"); // the result of prompt is a string, not a number
            break;

        case "18":
            alert("This works!");
            break;

        default:
            alert("Any value not equal to one above");
        }
    </p>

    <h1>Functions</h1>

    <p>
     We covered three ways to create a function in JavaScript:

     Function Declaration: the function in the main code flow
     function sum(a, b) {
        let result = a + b;
      
        return result;
      }

      Function Expression: the function in the context of an expression

        let sum = function(a, b) {
        let result = a + b;
        return result;
        };

        Arrow functions:

        // expression on the right side
        let sum = (a, b) => a + b;

        // or multi-line syntax with { ... }, need return here:
        let sum = (a, b) => {
        // ...
        return a + b;
        }

        // without arguments
        let sayHi = () => alert("Hello");

        // with a single argument
        let double = n => n * 2;
    </p>

    <p>
        Functions may have local variables: those declared inside its body or its parameter list. Such variables are only visible inside the function.
        Parameters can have default values: function sum(a = 1, b = 2) {...}.
        Functions always return something. If there’s no return statement, then the result is undefined.
    </p>
