<!-- External scripts
If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file.

Script files are attached to HTML with the src attribute: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    
    <head>
        <title>External scripts</title>
    </head>
    <script src="./Scripts/script.js"></script>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>


<!-- 
    Here, /path/to/script.js is an absolute path to the script from the site root. 
    One can also provide a relative path from the current page. 
    For instance, src="script.js", just like src="./script.js", would mean a file "script.js" in the current folder.

    We can give a full URL as well. For instance:

    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>
    To attach several scripts, use multiple tags:

    <script src="/js/script1.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/script2.js"></script>
    …
-->

<!-- Modern markup
    The <script> tag has a few attributes that are rarely used nowadays but can still be found in old code:

    The type attribute: <script type=…>
    The old HTML standard, HTML4, required a script to have a type. Usually it was type="text/javascript". 
    It’s not required anymore. Also, the modern HTML standard totally changed the meaning of this attribute. 
    Now, it can be used for JavaScript modules. 

    The language attribute: <script language=…>
    This attribute was meant to show the language of the script. This attribute no longer makes sense because 
    JavaScript is the default language. There is no need to use it.


    Comments before and after scripts.
    In really ancient books and guides, you may find comments inside <script> tags, like this:

    <script type="text/javascript"><--
        ...
    //--` </script>
    This trick isn’t used in modern JavaScript. These comments hide JavaScript code from old browsers that didn’t know how to process the <script> tag. Since browsers released in the last 15 years don’t have this issue, this kind of comment can help you identify really old code.

<!-- 
    Please note:
    As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.
    The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.
    Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.
    That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.
