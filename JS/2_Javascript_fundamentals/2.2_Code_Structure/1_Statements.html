    <!-- We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon. -->
    <!-- statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable: -->
    <script>
        alert('Hello');
        alert('World');
    </script>

    <!-- A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists. -->
    <!-- Both will work -->
    <script>
        alert('Hello1')
        alert('World1')
    </script>

    <!-- Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion. -->

    <script>
        alert(3 +
        1
        + 2);
    </script>
    <!-- The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus "+", then it is an “incomplete expression”, so a semicolon there would be incorrect. And in this case, that works as intended. -->

    <!-- But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed. -->

    <script>
        alert("Hello")
        // alert("Hello");
        // next will not show 1 2 on removing semicolon
        [1, 2].forEach(alert)
    </script>

    <!-- That’s because JavaScript does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So, the code in the last example is treated as a single statement. -->

    <script>
        // same as before
        alert("Hello hi")[1, 2].forEach(alert);
    </script>
