    <h3>
        Constants
        To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let:
    </h3>
    <script>
        const myBirthday = '28.09.2003';
        // myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!
    </script>

    <h3>
        Uppercase constants
        There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember values that are known before execution.

        Such constants are named using capital letters and underscores.

        For instance, let’s make constants for colors in so-called “web” (hexadecimal) format:
    </h3>
    <script>
        const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
        const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
        const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
        const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

        // ...when we need to pick a color
        let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
        alert(color); // #FF7F00
    </script>

    <h4>
        Benefits:

        COLOR_ORANGE is much easier to remember than "#FF7F00".
        It is much easier to mistype "#FF7F00" than COLOR_ORANGE.
        When reading the code, COLOR_ORANGE is much more meaningful than #FF7F00.
    </h4>
    <p> capital-named constants are only used as aliases for “hard-coded” values.</p>

    <p>
        Name things right
       
        A variable name should have a clean, obvious meaning, describing the data that it stores.

        Variable naming is one of the most important and complex skills in programming. A glance at variable names can reveal which code was written by a beginner versus an experienced developer.

      
        Some good-to-follow rules are:

        Use human-readable names like userName or shoppingCart.
        Stay away from abbreviations or short names like a, b, and c, unless you know what you’re doing.
        Make names maximally descriptive and concise. Examples of bad names are data and value. Such names say nothing. It’s only okay to use them if the context of the code makes it exceptionally obvious which data or value the variable is referencing.
        Agree on terms in your mind. If a site visitor is called a “user” then we should name related variables currentUser or newUser instead of currentVisitor or newManInTown.
        An extra variable is good, not evil in case of debugging.

        Summary
        We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.

        let – is a modern variable declaration.
        var – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all;
        const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
