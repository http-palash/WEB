        Variable naming
        There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

        The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
        The first character must not be a digit.
    </p>
    <p>

        Examples of valid names:
        let userName;
        let test123;
        
        let $ = 1; // declared a variable with the name "$"
        let _ = 2; // and now a variable with the name "_"
        
        alert($ + _); // 3
    </p>
        
    <p>

        Examples of incorrect variable names:
        
        let 1a; // cannot start with a digit
        
        let my-name; // hyphens '-' aren't allowed in the name
        
        Non-Latin letters are allowed, but not recommended
        It is possible to use any language, including Cyrillic letters, Chinese logograms and so on, like this:
        
        let имя = '...';
        let 我 = '...';
        
        Reserved names
        There is a list of reserved words, which cannot be used as variable names because they are used by the language itself.
        
        For example: let, class, return, and function are reserved.
        
        The code below gives a syntax error:
        
        let let = 5; // can't name a variable "let", error!
        let return = 5; // also can't name it "return", error!
    </p>

        An assignment without use strict
        Normally, we need to define a variable before using it. But in the old times, it was technically possible to create a variable by a mere assignment of the value without using let. This still works now if we don’t put use strict in our scripts to maintain compatibility with old scripts.
        <script>
            // note: no "use strict" in this example
            
            /* "use strict" im this case 
                Uncaught ReferenceError: num is not defined
                at 3_variable_naming.html:60:17
                num = 5; // the variable "num" is created if it didn't exist
            */
            alert(num); // 5
            </script>
    </p>
