    <title>Use of var</title>

<body>
    <!-- In older scripts, you may also find another keyword: var instead of let: -->
    <!--The var keyword is almost the same as let. It also declares a variable but in a slightly different, “old-school” way.
        There are subtle differences between let and var -->
        <!-- Var
        variables are function-scoped, which means they are accessible anywhere within the function in which they are declared.
        Let
        variables are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the block of code in which they are declared. -->
        <!-- Another difference between var and let is that var variables can be re-declared within the same scope, while let variables cannot. For example, the following code will cause an error:
        JavaScript
         }
        test(); -->
        <script>
            function test() {
            var x = 1;
            let y = 2;
            var x = 3; // Error: x has already been declared
            //   let y = 4; // Error: y has already been declared
            }
        </script>

        <!-- Declaring let twice triggers an error -->
        <script>
            // let message = "This";
            // // repeated 'let' leads to an error
            // let message = "That"; // SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared
        </script>
        <!-- We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other. -->

        <script>
            let hello = 'Hello world!';
            let message;
            // copy 'Hello world' from hello into message
            message = hello;

            // now two variables hold the same data
            alert(hello); // Hello world!
            alert(message); // Hello world!
        </script>
