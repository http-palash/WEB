    <h1>Basic operators, maths</h1>
    <h2>We know many operators from school. They are things like addition +, multiplication *, subtraction -, and so on
    </h2>

    <h3>Terms: “unary”, “binary”, “operand”</h3>

    <p>An operand – is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of 5 * 2 there are two
        operands: the left operand is 5 and the right operand is 2. Sometimes, people call these “arguments” instead of
        “operands”.</p>
    <p>An operator is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of a number:
    </p>

    <script>
        let x = 1;
        x = -x;
        alert(x); // -1, unary negation was applied
    </script>

    <h3>
        An operator is binary if it has two operands. The same minus exists in binary form as well:
    </h3>

    <script>
        x = 1, y = 3;
        alert(y - x); // 2, binary minus subtracts values
    </script>

    <h1>Maths</h1>
    <p>
        The following math operations are supported:

        Addition +,
        Subtraction -,
        Multiplication *,
        Division /,
        Remainder %,
        Exponentiation **.
        The first four are straightforward, while % and ** need a few words about them.
    </p>

    <h1>Remainder %</h1>

    <p>
        The remainder operator %, despite its appearance, is not related to percents.

        The result of a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b.
    </p>

    <script>
        alert(5 % 2); // 1, the remainder of 5 divided by 2
        alert(8 % 3); // 2, the remainder of 8 divided by 3
        alert(8 % 4); // 0, the remainder of 8 divided by 4
    </script>

    <h1>Exponentiation **</h1>
    <p>
        The exponentiation operator a ** b raises a to the power of b.

        In school maths, we write that as ab.
    </p>

    <script>
        alert(2 ** 2); // 2² = 4
        alert(2 ** 3); // 2³ = 8
        alert(2 ** 4); // 2⁴ = 16
    </script>

    <p>
        Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is defined for non-integer numbers as well.

        For example, a square root is an exponentiation by ½:
    </p>

    alert( 4 ** (1/2) ); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root)
    alert( 8 ** (1/3) ); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)

    <h1>String concatenation with binary +</h1>
    <p>Usually, the plus operator + sums numbers.

        But, if the binary + is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them:</p>

    <script>
        let s = "my" + "string";
        alert(s); // mystring
    </script>

    <p>
        Note that if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.
        It doesn’t matter whether the first operand is a string or the second one.
    </p>

    <script>
        alert('1' + 2); // "12"
        alert(2 + '1'); // "21"
    </script>

    <p>more complex example:</p>

    <script>
        alert(2 + 2 + '1'); // "41" and not "221"
    </script>

    <p>operators work one after another. The first + sums two numbers, so it returns 4, then the next + adds the string
        1 to it, so it’s like 4 + '1' = '41'.</p>
    <script>
        alert('1' + 2 + 2); // "122" and not "14"
    </script>
    <p>Here, the first operand is a string, the compiler treats the other two operands as strings too. The 2 gets
        concatenated to '1', so it’s like '1' + 2 = "12" and "12" + 2 = "122".</p>

    <p>The binary + is the only operator that supports strings in such a way. Other arithmetic operators work only with
        numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.</p>

    <script>
        alert(6 - '2'); // 4, converts '2' to a number
        alert('6' / '2'); // 3, converts both operands to numbers
    </script>

    <h1>Numeric conversion, unary +</h1>
    <p>The plus + exists in two forms: the binary form that we used above and the unary form.

        The unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator + applied to a single value, doesn’t do anything to
        numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.</p>

    <script>
        // No effect on numbers
        x = 1;
        alert(+x); // 1

        let y = -2;
        alert(+y); // -2

        // Converts non-numbers
        alert(+true); // 1
        alert(+"");   // 0
    </script>

    <p>It actually does the same thing as Number(...), but is shorter.</p>

    <p>The need to convert strings to numbers arises very often. For example, if we are getting values from HTML form
        fields, they are usually strings. What if we want to sum them?</p>
    <p>The binary plus would add them as strings:</p>

    <script>
        let apples = "2";
        let oranges = "3";

        alert(apples + oranges); // "23", the binary plus concatenates strings
    </script>

    <p>If we want to treat them as numbers, we need to convert and then sum them:</p>

    <script>
        apples = "2";
        oranges = "3";

        // both values converted to numbers before the binary plus
        alert(+apples + +oranges); // 5

        // the longer variant
        // alert( Number(apples) + Number(oranges) ); // 5
    </script>
    <p>
        From a mathematician’s standpoint, the abundance of pluses may seem strange. But from a programmer’s standpoint,
        there’s nothing special: unary pluses are applied first, they convert strings to numbers, and then the binary
        plus sums them up.

        Why are unary pluses applied to values before the binary ones? As we’re going to see, that’s because of their
        higher precedence.
