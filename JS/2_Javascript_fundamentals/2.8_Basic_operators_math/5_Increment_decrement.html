    <h1>Increment/decrement</h1>
    <p>Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations.</p>

    <h4>Increment ++ increases a variable by 1:</h4>

    <script>
        let counter = 2;
        counter++;        // works the same as counter = counter + 1, but is shorter
        alert(counter); // 3
    </script>

    <h4>Decrement -- decreases a variable by 1:</h4>

    <script>
        counter = 2;
        counter--;        // works the same as counter = counter - 1, but is shorter
        alert(counter); // 1
    </script>

    <p>Important:
        Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables. Trying to use it on a value like 5++ will give an error.
    </p>

    <p>
        The operators ++ and -- can be placed either before or after a variable.

        When the operator goes after the variable, it is in “postfix form”: counter++.
        The “prefix form” is when the operator goes before the variable: ++counter.
        Both of these statements do the same thing: increase counter by 1.

        Is there any difference? Yes, but we can only see it if we use the returned value of ++/--.

    </p>


    <script>
        // prefix form
        counter = 1;
        let a = ++counter; // (*)

        alert(a); // 2

        //  postfix form
        counter = 1;
        a = counter++; // (*) changed ++counter to counter++

        alert(a); // 1
    </script>

    <p>
        n the line (*), the postfix form counter++ also increments counter but returns the old value (prior to
        increment). So, the alert shows 1.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the result of increment/decrement is not used, there is no difference in which form to use:
    </p>

    <script>
        counter = 0;
        counter++;
        ++counter;
        alert(counter); // 2, the lines above did the same
    </script>

    <p>If we’d like to increase a value and immediately use the result of the operator, we need the prefix form:</p>

    <script>
        counter = 0;
        alert(++counter); // 1
    </script>

    <p>If we’d like to increment a value but use its previous value, we need the postfix form:</p>

    <script>
        counter = 0;
        alert(counter++); // 0
    </script>


    <h1>Increment/decrement among other operators</h1>

    <p>The operators ++/-- can be used inside expressions as well. Their precedence is higher than most other
        arithmetical operations.</p>

    <script>
        counter = 1;
        alert(2 * ++counter); // 4
        counter = 1;
        alert(2 * counter++); // 2, because counter++ returns the "old" value
    </script>

    <p>
        Though technically okay, such notation usually makes code less readable. One line does multiple things – not
        good.

        While reading code, a fast “vertical” eye-scan can easily miss something like counter++ and it won’t be obvious
        that the variable increased.
    </p>
