    <h1>Modify-in-place</h1>
    <p>We often need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in that same variable.</p>

    <script>
        let n = 2;
        n = n + 5;
        n = n * 2;
    </script>

    <p>
        This notation can be shortened using the operators += and *=:
    </p>

    <script>
        n = 2;
        n += 5; // now n = 7 (same as n = n + 5)
        n *= 2; // now n = 14 (same as n = n * 2)

        alert(n); // 14
    </script>

    <p>
        Short “modify-and-assign” operators exist for all arithmetical and bitwise operators: /=, -=, etc.

        Such operators have the same precedence as a normal assignment, so they run after most other calculations:
    </p>

    <script>
        n = 2;

        n *= 3 + 5; // right part evaluated first, same as n *= 8

        alert(n); // 16
    </script>
