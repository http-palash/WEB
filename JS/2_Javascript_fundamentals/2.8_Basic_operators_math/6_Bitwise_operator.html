    <h1>Bitwise operators</h1>

    <p>
        Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary
        representation.

        These operators are not JavaScript-specific. They are supported in most programming languages.

        The list of operators:

        AND ( & )
        OR ( | )
        XOR ( ^ )
        NOT ( ~ )
        LEFT SHIFT ( << ) RIGHT SHIFT (>> )
        ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( >>> )
            
        These operators are used very rarely, when we need to fiddle with numbers on the very lowest (bitwise)
        level. We wonâ€™t need these operators any time soon, as web development has little use of them, but in some
        special areas, such as cryptography, they are useful. You can read the Bitwise Operators chapter on MDN when
        a need arises.
