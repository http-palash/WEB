    <h1>Assignment</h1>

    <p>
        Let’s note that an assignment = is also an operator. It is listed in the precedence table with the very low
        priority of 2.

        That’s why, when we assign a variable, like x = 2 * 2 + 1, the calculations are done first and then the = is
        evaluated, storing the result in x.
    </p>

        Let’s note that an assignment = is also an operator. It is listed in the precedence table with the very low
        priority of 2.

        That’s why, when we assign a variable, like x = 2 * 2 + 1, the calculations are done first and then the = is
        evaluated, storing the result in x.
    </p>

    <script>
        let x = 2 * 2 + 1;

        alert(x); // 5
    </script>

    <p>Assignment = returns a value</p>

    <p>
        The fact of = being an operator, not a “magical” language construct has an interesting implication.

        All operators in JavaScript return a value. That’s obvious for + and -, but also true for =.

        The call x = value writes the value into x and then returns it.

        Demo that uses an assignment as part of a more complex expression:
    </p>

    <script>
        let a = 1;
        let b = 2;

        let c = 3 - (a = b + 1);

        alert(a); // 3
        alert(c); // 0
    </script>

    <p>
        the result of expression (a = b + 1) is the value which was assigned to a (that is 3). It is then used for
        further evaluations.

        Funny code, isn’t it? We should understand how it works, because sometimes we see it in JavaScript libraries.

        Although, please don’t write the code like that. Such tricks definitely don’t make code clearer or readable.
    </p>

    <h1>Chaining assignments</h1>
    <p>Another interesting feature is the ability to chain assignments:</p>

    <script>
        a, b, c;

        a = b = c = 2 + 2;

        alert(a); // 4
        alert(b); // 4
        alert(c); // 4
    </script>


    <p>
        Chained assignments evaluate from right to left. First, the rightmost expression 2 + 2 is evaluated and then
        assigned to the variables on the left: c, b and a. At the end, all the variables share a single value.

        Once again, for the purposes of readability it’s better to split such code into few lines:
    </p>

    <script>
        c = 2 + 2;
        b = c;
        a = c;
    </script>

    <p>
        That’s easier to read, especially when eye-scanning the code fast.
