    <h1>Comma</h1>

    <p>
        The comma operator , is one of the rarest and most unusual operators. Sometimes, it’s used to write shorter
        code, so we need to know it in order to understand what’s going on.

        The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma ,. Each of them is
        evaluated but only the result of the last one is returned.

    </p>

    <script>
        let a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);
        alert(a); // 7 (the result of 3 + 4)
    </script>
    <p>Here, the first expression 1 + 2 is evaluated and its result is thrown away. Then, 3 + 4 is evaluated and
        returned as the result.</p>
    <p>Comma has a very low precedence</p>

    <p>
        Please note that the comma operator has very low precedence, lower than =, so parentheses are important in the
        example above.

        Without them: a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4 evaluates + first, summing the numbers into a = 3, 7, then the assignment
        operator = assigns a = 3, and the rest is ignored. It’s like (a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4.
    </p>

    <p>
        // three operations in one line
        for (a = 1, b = 3, c = a * b; a < 10; a++) { ... } </p>
