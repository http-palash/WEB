    <h1>Loops while and for</h1>
    <p>
        We often need to repeat actions.

        For example, outputting goods from a list one after another or just running the same code for each number from 1
        to 10.

        Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.
    </p>


    <h1>The for…of and for…in loops</h1>
    <p>
        See for…in to loop over object properties.
        See for…of and iterables for looping over arrays and iterable objects.
    </p>

    <h1>The “while” loop</h1>
    <script>
        while (condition) {
            // code
            // so-called "loop body"
        }
    </script>
    <p>While the condition is truthy, the code from the loop body is executed.</p>


    <script>
        let i = 0;
        while (i < 3) { // shows 0, then 1, then 2
            alert(i);
            i++;
        }
    </script>

    <p>
        A single execution of the loop body is called an iteration. The loop in the example above makes three
        iterations.

        If i++ was missing from the example above, the loop would repeat (in theory) forever. In practice, the browser
        provides ways to stop such loops, and in server-side JavaScript, we can kill the process.

        Any expression or variable can be a loop condition, not just comparisons: the condition is evaluated and
        converted to a boolean by while.
    </p>

    <p>
        a shorter way to write while (i != 0) is while (i):
    </p>


    <script>
        i = 3;
        while (i) { // when i becomes 0, the condition becomes falsy, and the loop stops
            alert(i);
            i--;
        }
    </script>

    <h1>Curly braces are not required for a single-line body</h1>
    <p>The condition check can be moved below the loop body using the do..while syntax:</p>
    <script>
        do {
            // loop body
        } while (condition);
    </script>

    <p>The loop will first execute the body, then check the condition, and, while it’s truthy, execute it again and
        again.</p>
    <script>
        i = 0;
        do {
            alert(i);
            i++;
        } while (i < 3);
    </script>

    <h1>The “for” loop</h1>
    <p>The for loop is more complex, but it’s also the most commonly used loop.</p>

    <script>
        for (begin; condition; step) {
            // ... loop body ...
        }
        for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { // shows 0, then 1, then 2
            alert(i);
        }
    </script>

    <p>

        part
        begin let i = 0 Executes once upon entering the loop.
        condition i 3 Checked before every loop iteration. If false, the loop stops. body alert(i) Runs again and
        again while the condition is truthy. step i++ Executes after the body on each iteration.
    </p>


    <p>
        The general loop algorithm works like this:

        Run begin
        → (if condition → run body and run step)
        → (if condition → run body and run step)
        → (if condition → run body and run step)
        → ...
    </p>

    <p>
        // for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) alert(i) // run begin let i=0 // if condition → run body and run step if (i < 3)
            { alert(i); i++ } // if condition → run body and run step if (i < 3) { alert(i); i++ } // if condition → run
            body and run step if (i < 3) { alert(i); i++ } // ...finish, because now i==3 </p>

            <h1>Inline variable declaration</h1>
            <p> the “counter” variable i is declared right in the loop. This is called an “inline” variable declaration.
                Such variables are visible only inside the loop.</p>

            <script>
                for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                    alert(i); // 0, 1, 2
                }
                alert(i); // error, no such variable
            </script>
            <p>Instead of defining a variable, we could use an existing one:</p>

            <script>
                //  let i = 0;
                i = 0;

                for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) { // use an existing variable
                    alert(i); // 0, 1, 2
                }

                alert(i); // 3, visible, because declared outside of the loop
            </script>
