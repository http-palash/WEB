        The enormous space rock, which orbits the sun every three years, was first discovered in 2011. The European
        Space Agency says that it is bigger than 99.99 per cent of the asteroids that are known to be near Earth.

        It will still be 17 times further away from Earth than the moon, despite coming within 4.1 million miles.
        2011 UL21 isn't projected to collide with Earth. Nonetheless, it momentarily had a 1 in 1,000,000 possibility of
        hitting our planet in 2029.
        However, on November 2, 2011, the probability decreased to 1 in 71 million. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
        says that the asteroid, which has an absolute magnitude of 15.8, is also one of the brightest.
